Of course! Here is a short requirements document for your "Flat Finder Dashboard" project. This is designed to be a clear, concise guide for a project you can build in a single evening.

Requirements Document: Flat Finder Dashboard

Version: 1.0
Date: 2023-10-27
Project Title: FlatPack Dashboard

1. Project Overview & Goal

The goal is to create a simple, single-page web application to track and manage potential flat listings during an apartment search. The application will serve as a personal, centralized dashboard, eliminating the need for scattered notes or spreadsheets. The primary constraint is to keep the scope minimal enough to be completed in a single evening (approx. 3-5 hours).

2. Target User

A single user (you) managing their own flat-hunting process. No multi-user support or authentication is required for this initial version.

3. Key Features (Functional Requirements)

The application will be a single-page interface with the following components:

3.1. Add New Listing Form:

An input field for the Address or Title of the listing (e.g., "123 Main St, Apt 4B"). This is a required field.

An input field for the Listing URL (e.g., a link to Rightmove, Zillow, or another property site).

A textarea for Description & Notes (e.g., "Good light, noisy street, contact agent Jane Doe").

A dropdown/select input for Status with predefined options:

Interested (Default)

Contacted

Viewing Scheduled

Rejected

A "Save Listing" button to submit the form.

3.2. Listings Display:

A list of all saved flat listings, displayed as individual cards.

Each card should concisely show the Address/Title, Status, and Notes.

Each card will have a clickable link to the original listing URL.

Each card must have a Delete button to remove the listing.

Each card must have an Edit button that allows changing the status or notes.

3.3. Interactive Map:

A small map component displayed on the page.

When a user clicks on a listing card, a marker should appear on the map at the corresponding address.

The map does not need to show all listings at once, only the currently selected one to keep it simple.

4. Data Model (Supabase)

A single database table is required.

Table Name: listings

Columns:

id (uuid, Primary Key) - Handled by Supabase

created_at (timestamp) - Handled by Supabase

address (text, not null) - The primary location identifier.

url (text, nullable) - The URL to the online listing.

description (text, nullable) - User's personal notes.

status (text, not null, default: 'Interested') - The current status of the application.

Note: Latitude and longitude will not be stored in the database for V1. The address will be geocoded on the fly in the client-side application to place the map marker.

5. Technical Stack

Backend & Database: Supabase (for the Postgres database and instant APIs).

Frontend Framework: React (using Vite or Create React App for setup).

Data Fetching: Supabase Client Library (@supabase/supabase-js).

Mapping: React Leaflet library with OpenStreetMap tiles (free, no API key required for basic use).

Styling: Simple vanilla CSS or a classless CSS framework like Pico.css to ensure a clean look with minimal effort.

6. Non-Functional Requirements

Performance: The app should load quickly and feel responsive. Data fetching should be efficient.

Usability: The interface must be simple and intuitive. All functionality should be available on a single page.

Scope: Strictly limited to the features above to ensure completion in one evening.

7. Out of Scope for V1 (Future Ideas)

User Authentication / Login

Advanced filtering or sorting of listings (e.g., by price, date).

Automatic scraping of data from listing URLs.

Image uploads.

Email/SMS notifications.

Deployment (though easily deployable on services like Vercel or Netlify).
